One of my favourite books on creativity, writing and courage is A War Of Art by Steven Pressfield. In this new book the author reveals how he arrived at his approach to writing. During his life he was at rock bottom, unable to write without money. Through a series of hard, low-paying jobs, he built up the grit he now praises. The book is also about calling, whatever the author is good at, writing books is what calls him in the end. The book is really well written, the short chapters really help and I was able to finish the book in a couple of days. But I was expecting something more, some new idea, but I just got a nice story and a better insight into Pressfield's mind.
