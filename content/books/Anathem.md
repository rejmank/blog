Neal Stephensons book almost always leave me fascinated by the ideas they contain  and this one was not different. I am writing this review almost 9 months after finishing the book but I still remember the feeling of being immersed in the world Neal is building. After like 120 pages I thought that the book could probably end, and It would be a hell of a story, but I still had 400 pages to finish and it didnt slowed down (ok, maybe last chapter or two). I would describe the book as a name of the rose but scifi. It was great but the less you know the better. Read it yourself.
