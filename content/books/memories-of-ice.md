Third book in a series that is 1K pages long? Why not. I think that so far this was the best part of the series (I red only the first two). All the parts of the stories worked together beautifully. The finale was epic and with the right amount of main characters dying. Through the whole book I had a feeling that this is simmilar to Illiad and I just couldnt crack why, unitl one of the gods si amog the mere mortals discussing the next steps of a military campaing: The world where gods are simply real, and the humans are just a pawns they are pushing in their games this is what the worlds have in common. Looking forward to next part of the series!
