I read about Scotland as part of my preparation for a trip. I wanted to get a general idea of the history of Scotland, but I chose the wrong book. The book did not even start with prehistory, but with the formation of the mountains that make up Scotland, and spent about 50 pages just on that. That, in a nutshell, is the problem I have with the book, it goes too deep into too many subjects. Maybe I should choose something shorter, or just read the wiki page on Scottish history. But my context can only explain part of my disappointment, I feel that the book is just the bad middle ground. Too detailed to be a nice overview, but too shallow to go deep into any of the parts. I did like the parts that covered periods from the 17th century onwards and the Scottish Enlightenment will be something I will return to and focus on.
