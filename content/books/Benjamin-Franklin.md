After reading [Leadership in turbulent times](leadership-in-turbulent-times) I wanted to explore further into U.S. history, and picking up a biography by Walter Isaacson is always a good choice. What this book does great is portraying Franklin as a human being, with all the flaws and all the greatness of the founding father, bringing him to life on the page.One aspect that really surprised me was how old Franklin was during his diplomatic mission in France.

For my rating, I would divide the book into two parts. The first part, about Franklin’s early life, was really enjoyable, maybe because it is closest to me in terms of age and problems that Frankling was dealing with.. The second part, covering the American Revolution, was also engaging. However, as someone not deeply knowing the U.S. history, I would have appreciated more context and background. Despite this, it is a great read.

# Notes

 > 
 > As part of his self-improvement course, Franklin read the essays, took brief notes, and laid them aside for a few days. Then he tried to recreate the essay in his own words, after which he compared his composition to the original. Sometimes he would jumble up the notes he took, so that he would have to figure out on his own the best order to build the essay’s argument.

 > 
 > So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do.”2

 > 
 > A secret to being more revered than resented, he learned, was to display (at least when he could muster the discipline) a self-deprecating humor, unpretentious demeanor, and unaggressive style in conversation.9

 > 
 > Knowledge, he realized, “was obtained rather by the use of the ear than of the tongue

 > 
 > Franklin’s favorite theme: slow and steady diligence is the true way to wealth

 > 
 > The present little sacrifice of your vanity will afterwards be amply repaid
