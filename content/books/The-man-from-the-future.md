The reason I read biographies is to learn about the person. How they work, What moments seems to shape them, What they struggled with? The man from the future fails in this regard. It was more an intro into fields that Von Neumann contributed to sprinkled with a few well known stories from Von Neumann life. Ok book, terrible biography.
