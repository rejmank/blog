There are moments when you simply know that this is not your last dance with the book. That you just red something that will be with you for the rest of your life and there will be always something new with each reading. This was the case of Mister and Magrita for me. I have a pet theory that you can point a great piece of art when you can know the whole story, have it spoiled by someone to the details and still enjoy the art as if it all was suprise. As with other classics, I do not think I am good enough to analyse, god forbid to rate so this is just a personal ode on one of the best books I ever read. I loved the first chapter on the Patriarch Ponds, it was as if I am watching the scene from distance, feeling the hot day and chills on the neck. I loved the parts about Pilat almost made me feel the head pain and the weight of the history on Pilat shoulders. The great depiction of devil who just brings what is in people... Iam looking forward to reread this one.
