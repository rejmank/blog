There are moments when you simply know that this won't be your last dance with a book. You've read something that will stay with you for the rest of your life, and you'll always discover something new with each reading. This was the case for me with The Master and Margarita. I have a pet theory that you know a piece of art is great when you can have the whole story spoiled for you and still enjoy it as if it were a surprise. As with other classics, I don't consider myself qualified to analyze or rate it, so this is just a personal ode to one of the best books I've ever read. I loved the first chapter about the Patriarch Ponds. It was as if I were watching the scene from a distance, feeling the hot day and the chills on my neck. I loved the parts about Pilate; they almost made me feel his headache and the weight of history on his shoulders. The devil's depiction was great; he simply brings out what is in people. I am looking forward to rereading it.
