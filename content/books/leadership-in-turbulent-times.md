The history of the USA is a fascinating subject and the people who are elected to the highest positions are a great topic to study. Leadership in Turbulent Times is actually a short biography of four US presidents, focusing on the events that shaped the way each president led his people. The most interesting part was the realisation of how much courage the US leadership has lost in the last 50? years. I cannot imagine the things described in the book being dealt with by the current leadership. Do the right thing, even if it is unpopular, and do it in a way that benefits you in the end. Personally I would reduce the number of presidents covered and make the book shorter, I tended to lose focus towards the end of the book.
