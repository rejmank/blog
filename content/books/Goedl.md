So this is how you write a biography! After reading a [The man from the future](projects/blog_content/books/The-man-from-the-future.md)
I was scared to dive into another biography but man, this was a great read! The book starts with an introduction to the time and place of Goedl's birth. The description of the society and the life for Jewish man in the monarchy helps to set the stage before Goedl himself is introduced. This prelude helped me to understand  just how much change there was during Goedl's lifetime and better understand him. The book have the right balance between describing of Goedl's life and a description of the his work. It also addresses the elephant in the room, but without trying to be scandalous. I am glad that another iconic figure from the beginning of the century has a biography that I can wholeheartedly recommend.
