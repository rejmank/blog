If you should read just one book about ancient Rome, this should be it. Rather than telling the "story" of Rome from start to finish, each chapter covers a single topic. In the end, you get a pretty good overview of Rome's history, from its emergence from the fog of a founding myth to its violent uprising, and finally to its end, which is almost as foggy as the beginning. I really like that this book was written by a woman. She chose topics that male authors might overlook or not give enough focus to. Those moments were when I felt that I started to understand the Romans. I began to understand the similarities and differences, and where my own thinking originates.
