You don't write reviews of classics; you analyse them. However, I don't feel capable of doing that. So, I will mostly sum up my experience, and I will also provide some tips on how to actually enjoy reading the Iliad. The first tip is to read Stephen Fry's version of Troy first. It's important to know the main characters and their backstory.
Focus on how much time elapses during each chapter — it's interesting to see how 10 days can feel like 10 years.
Expect some brutality — I was really surprised at how brutal the book is. When the men are fighting, every third sentence describes how someone was killed and which parts of their body were pierced by what.
And don't rush it; enjoy the process, page by page.
