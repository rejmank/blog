Anohter one from the [great list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkVOncbYXPc&pp=ygUWbXkgdG9wIDEwIHNjaSBmaSBib29rcw%3D%3D) by Jared Sanderson. I usually hate the first part of the post apocalyptic books so skiping the apocalypse itself was a great thing for me. This book is on the shorter side and yea it was good for the first two parts and great in the third. I have no idea how only the third would work on its own but after the two parts covering the civilization rebuilding from the ground up, the third part hit hard. I also have a soft sport for books about monks so that is another plus.
