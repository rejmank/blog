Books are ideal medium to share feelings and experiences that you have no other way to obtain and Babel is the book that proves it. Set in colonial England that is powered by silver bars inscribed with translations, in society that on one hand desperatly needs foreiginers and on other hand will never make you one of them. 
I really enjoyed the language and style as I would expect from book about language. The story itself is good with few plot holes that newertheless did not prevent me from enjoyment. Listen to podcast with [author](https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/rebecca-f-kuang/)and then read the book.
