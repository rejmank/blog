Books are the ideal medium for sharing feelings and experiences that are otherwise unavailable, and Babel is the book that proves it. It is set in colonial England, powered by silver bars inscribed with translations, in a society that on the one hand desperately needs foreigners and on the other will never make you one of them.
I really enjoyed the language and style, as I would expect from a book about language. The story itself is good, with a few plot holes that did not stop me from enjoying it. Listen to the podcast with [author] (https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/rebecca-f-kuang/) and then read the book.
