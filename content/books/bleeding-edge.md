Iam one of the readers that needed to be pushed by one battle after another to dive into Pynchon. Bleeding edge was the most accessible to me so that was where I started. And I was not really aware how funny Pynchon is. The story had great pacing and I was not really aware ho funny Pynchon can be. Another impresive feat is how much knowledge and trivia the book have inside. But I still have a feeling that I expected bit more. Maybe im his other books?
