I find out about Steve Magness on his youtube channel where he was speaking about training for endurance athlettes. This book is about sport psychology not a training itself. The main theme is redefining what "toughness" is. It comments on the current popular understaning on where toughness comes from and what it is and offers different understanding. I liked the book and the message, as well as that ther were specific tips to work on toughness. But looking back, not much stayed with me a month after reading the book. Maybe because there is simply not that much ideas that would not be covered in different books I red? Still great book.
