I think that I will read Odyssey again but I cannot say the same for Illiad. But still glad to read the book (yes, I can tell people at parties that I red Illiad and see the confusion, why the fuck is he telling me that?). I do not think that I can add anything new or original about the book but having a story that starts after 9 years of war and ends sometimes before the war is resolved is weird.
