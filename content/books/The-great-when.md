When the author of your favourite comic starts writing prose, it's a must-read! I wanted to read the original English version, but I'm glad I opted for the Czech translation. The translation was excellent - I would have missed out on a lot of beautiful language otherwise. It wasn't the story itself that kept me hooked, but the theatre of the various weird characters and their interactions with a boy who didn't know what to do with himself. His dullness, naivety and good heart are always appealing together. I enjoyed the book and am looking forward to the next one in the series.
