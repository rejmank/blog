Planeta9 Is for sure my favourite book publisher. That is why I picked the book in first place. The second reason was that I boarded a 3hour train ride after bike trip and I needed something to read. And I think I picked the right book. It is light reading, funny with nice story and small twist at the end. It is not a book I would read again or was thinking about. It`s just a nice story.
