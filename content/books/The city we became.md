Iam sucker for the current women led scifi movement. I love how it is not so much focused on the technology but more on a humans. The city we became was no different. I had this book bought for like 5 years before finally digging in and it was good? The premise of the book is original and I really enjoied how the book worked with the different city parts and their genius loci. There are second book in series already out so I will most probably grab it.
