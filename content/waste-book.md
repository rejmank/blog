### 30.10 FVLCRVM - EERC
This recording is a nice suprise. Colorfull electronic, funny with a lot of great touches. 4/5 Euro disco song as one of my favourites was not on my bingo. 

### 29.10.2025 Elemental
Ok story, funny 3/5? (Iam maybee too positive because I did not had to watch cars for like 100th time this year...)

### 25.10.2025 Fifth element
There was a screening of the fifth element in a local cinema, and it was right when we had free evening so why not? And I can see why this movie was such a hit, on the other hand it did not aged that well. It was green, not super-green. 

### 23.10.2025 raise the floor
today was not the most productive day. For some reason I could not focus and just switched from one thing to another. But still, I finished some things. A few moths back I would probably just wasted the day. what changed? I raised the floor. My worst days are not as bad as they used to be. High minumum is always more important than high maximum. 

### 22.10.2025 Munich
I spend three days in Munich with my son. We had great time. Managed to visit BMW museum (3 of 5, figured out that the cars themselves are not enough...), BMW Velt (3 of 5, he got free toy car and we spend bunch of time drawing cars in the Kids area). Munich technical museum (deutches museum) - Highlight of the trip, Kid loved it, I loved it and we did not even saw everything. If I would visit this museum as 10 years old kid, I would need to be forced out of the museum. Even for the 3 yaear old, there were a lot of interactive stuff, kids area with fire truck made into obstacle course it was great. 
We managed the 5 hour drive pretty well and a pro tip, get an apartman, with kid it is so much easier when you have some room to play in the evening and a kitchen to prepare at least a tea. 

### 16.10.2025 Just dump it all there 
Iam always looking for a better way to manage my brain fried by caffeine and Twitter (twitter sober for almost 4years now!). Recently I red a great article about someone managing their ADHD. One of the points was to dump all things into Todoist, so I tried to do so and man, it is great! We will see how long I will manage to use it but it has been month so far and still going strong.   

### 15.10.2025 Reading plan for the rest of the year
The end of the year is scarry close so time to wrap up the reading plan for this year

- Do hard things (50% in 150 pages remaining)
- Secret lives of Romans (30% in 100 pages remaining)
- Solitary confinment (120 pages)
- Last two books of books of the new sun (700 pages)
- Memories of Ice (992 pages)
- Bleeding Edge (512 pages, Christmas Read)
So it makes about 2500 pages for 78 days or about ~35 pages per day.  

### 13.10.2025 Backlog cleanup 
I saw bunch of movies and plays I would like to remember so in no particular order


- One Battle After Another -> I had a fun and bougth a Pynchon book the next day
- Sirat -> I started to listen Techno, best movie of the year so far!
- Americká jízda = Set of plays on the "america" theme from Drak threathre in my hometown. It is a theathre focused on kids/teenagers but I love their plays anyway. 
  - Huckleberry Finn -> I loved it, great acting, great stage.
  - White Fang -> Great idea with camera play as the dogs POV but the theme did not suit me
  - Route -> Kerouackish play about growing up on the road, about non conformity and the price of it 

### 12.10.2025 visma vuelta aftermovie
i just love them, one hour, few look behind the scenes, some emotions...

### 8.3.2025 - Finished Odyssey

"Review" pending... What I ride it was not what I expected at all
### 6.2.2025 - Japanese way of new-years resolution

Harimus - Kakizome, Japanese way of new-years resolution I have my tradition of setting new year goals. Looking back I start to gravitate to similar approach to not having hard SMART goals but "theme of the year". The kaligraphy part really give the practice an elegance.
### 4.2.2025 - Nabeel S.Qureshi - principles

Nabeel S. Qureshi - principles I like list of principles and I am working on my own. Few great gems in here:

    Do things fast. Things don’t actually take much time (as measured by a stopwatch); resistance/procrastination does. “Slow is fake”. If no urgency exists, impose some.

    Pay attention to your production/consumption balance. If you’re only consuming and not producing, fix that.

### 3.2.2025

Thorsten Ball - No, typing can be the bottleneck I think about friction a lot lately. And a lot of things I want to do have writing as a component. Removing friction by being able to put my thougths on the screen efortless is a big friction remover
1.1.2025 - Humanities in 52 weeks

I started to going through Ted Goya "humanities in 52 weeks"
just testing
jist testing if i can do stuff from github repo

### 05.05.2025 Pentiment

I recently plugged in my old PC to keep my child entertained with some cars when he was sick. And since i bought game pass I started to explore if anything interesting is there. And I stumbled upon a pentiment. Iam a big fan of history and also a Disco Elysium so I downloaded it and yea, it was great! I liked how real the world felt, how important the religion is for the people. And the graphics style. The story itself was good enough but it did not hit as much as Disco Elysium. Still well worth playing
