### 13.10.2025 Backlog cleanup 
I saw bunch of movies and plays I would like to remember so in no particular order
    - One Battle After Another -> I had a fun and bougth a Pynchon book the next day
    - Sirat -> I started to listen Techno, best movie of the year so far!
    - Americká jízda = Set of plays on the "america" theme from Drak threathre in my hometown. It is a theathre focused on kids/teenagers but I love their plays anyway. 
        - Huckleberry Finn -> I loved it, great acting, great stage.
        - White Fang -> Great idea with camera play as the dogs POV but the theme did not suit me
        - Route -> Kerouackish play about growing up on the road, about non conformity and the price of it

### 8.3.2025 - Finished Odyssey

"Review" pending... What I ride it was not what I expected at all
### 6.2.2025 - Japanese way of new-years resolution

Harimus - Kakizome, Japanese way of new-years resolution I have my tradition of setting new year goals. Looking back I start to gravitate to similar approach to not having hard SMART goals but "theme of the year". The kaligraphy part really give the practice an elegance.
### 4.2.2025 - Nabeel S.Qureshi - principles

Nabeel S. Qureshi - principles I like list of principles and I am working on my own. Few great gems in here:

    Do things fast. Things don’t actually take much time (as measured by a stopwatch); resistance/procrastination does. “Slow is fake”. If no urgency exists, impose some.

    Pay attention to your production/consumption balance. If you’re only consuming and not producing, fix that.

### 3.2.2025

Thorsten Ball - No, typing can be the bottleneck I think about friction a lot lately. And a lot of things I want to do have writing as a component. Removing friction by being able to put my thougths on the screen efortless is a big friction remover
1.1.2025 - Humanities in 52 weeks

I started to going through Ted Goya "humanities in 52 weeks"
just testing
jist testing if i can do stuff from github repo

### 05.05.2025 Pentiment

I recently plugged in my old PC to keep my child entertained with some cars when he was sick. And since i bought game pass I started to explore if anything interesting is there. And I stumbled upon a pentiment. Iam a big fan of history and also a Disco Elysium so I downloaded it and yea, it was great! I liked how real the world felt, how important the religion is for the people. And the graphics style. The story itself was good enough but it did not hit as much as Disco Elysium. Still well worth playing
