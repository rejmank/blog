# Javascript learning resources

This article is a compilation of resources I would use again while learning a node.js or react. It contains everything from free articles, paid courses to books. There are not sorted in any particular order.

## 33 JS concepts

### https://github.com/leonardomso/33-js-concepts

What is great about this collection is that it sums up all the things that you should be at least familiar with while using JavaScript. I would focus mostly on the understanding **call stack**, **function scope, block scope, lexical scope**, **Message Queue, and Event loop**, **closures**, **map, reduce filter**. 

## Node best practices

### https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices

Another git collection. This time of best NodeJS practices. I cannot say that I agree with everything on 100% but it is a great starting point when you try to do your next project the right way.

## Frontend masters

### www.frontendmasters.com

This is an awesome company producing awesome content. The price is a little higher than usual but it is worth every penny. The courses are recorded lections from practitioners and the quality of content is high. I would recommend courses from Kyle Simpson, Scott Moss, and Brian Londsdorf, but in the end, I did not encountered a bad course so pick what you are interested in.

## You don't know JavaScript

### https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS

If you want to go deep in JavaScript this is a go-to source for me. What I like about this series is that id does not leave out the quirky parts of JavaScript (looking at you JavaScript the good parts!) but forces you to understand them. Kyle Simpson has the unusual talent to describe difficult topics approachable. 

## Functional light JS

### https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS

Another book by Kyle Simpson. This time introduction to functional programming focusing on the important topics that you can apply immediately. I recommend pairing this book with his course on the same topic from frontend masters. 

## The road to React

### https://www.roadtoreact.com/

I learned to react to this eBook. I remember it was a really good introduction. I build some basic react app alongside this book as a reference source.

## Other

## https://epicreact.dev/

If I would like to go deeper in React or need to refresh it I would grab the epic react dev from Kent C. Dodds. I received a pretty good impression from everyone who bought the course, even senior react devs so this would be the choice for me.
