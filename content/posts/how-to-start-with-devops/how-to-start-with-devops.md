The internet is filled with tutorials for technologies and road maps with the premise of learning DevOps but in my opinion, the DevOps is less about technology and more about processes and mindset.

## What is DevOps?
To start with DevOps we first need to know what DevOps is. Amazon defines DevOps as a 
>DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity

This is a pretty good summary but see that it does not mention any particular technology. It is because it does not matter what technologies you use (but it can help), DevOps is about delivering **high quality** at **high velocity**. You don't need to use AWS, Kubernetes, and state of the art pipeline to do DevOps. The only requirement for DevOps is to be focused on the ability to deliver great products with high velocity. The tools and practices we use are just things that proved themselves to be the most efficient way to accomplish this. 

## So how to start with DevOps?
To start with DevOps start to think not about which technology to use but rather how to enable faster delivery and more quality. Take your project and look where most of the issues are. Is it non-existing tests? Start there. Do you have old branches that are a pain to merge? Introduce short-lived branches. Do you have a problem with ops being slow to respond? Try to embed them into your daily work. The most important thing is to know why. Will it save any money? Will It make any money? With answers to these questions, you will have more support from the managers to grant you the time and resources needed to start with DevOps, the technologies will follow.
