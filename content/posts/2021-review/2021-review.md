# 2021 Year in review
Last year I wrote my [2020 review](https://rejmank.com/post/2020-review). Today I would like to look back on my plans for last year to see what went well and what did not, and also plan a little bit for the next year. 

## Sport 
My biggest goal for 2020 was to lose some weight... Which I definitely managed. During the first quarantine, I lost about 13 kilograms which I did not gain again. I stopped eating sweets for the first three months but I started to eat them again in moderation. I still have problems managing the amount of sugar I eat but it gets better and learning how to manage food better is more valuable than crossing all sweats or junk food from my life. **I still have about 5-7 extra kilograms to ideal weight, that I would like to lose next year** but overall I check this one as a success. I continued with BJJ with the same enthusiasm as last year, that is something I will be continuing. The last thing is that I would like to **finally beat my long-term goal and run a half marathon in under 2 hours. With my current form, it should be no problem so the goal for me is one hour forty-five minutes.** 

## Work
Last review my goals was to learn a new functional language, start some bigger side project and focus on security or architecture. From those goals, I finished none. I tried a few new languages during quarantine, read some books about architecture, etc. In the end, my work pushed me into the DevOps direction. Although I did not accomplish any of my goals the DevOps direction gave me a lot of opportunities, I started organizing our internal DevOps talks and started with AWS. DevOps is a thing I would like to work on next year. **The goal for me is to finish AWS certified architect next year and continue organizing our internal DevOps talks.**

## Blog
The blog is my biggest regret of last year. Since lockdown ended I wrote exactly 0 articles. This is something I want to change. Since the start of the next week **I would like to publish a weekly article with one week off each month**. I feel that I need to make my writing better and I have a ton of new stuff to learn and for me writing is learning.

## Books
This year I read 30 books, most of them in audio form. I am still writing them down into my google sheet and there is **nothing I would like to change**. I read not 7 but 5 technical books. The only big change for me is that I started to use Instapaper for reading articles and most importantly readwise to make notes and review them. Both are great reading additions and well worth their price. 

## Conclusion
Overall 2021 was a good year for me. I lost weight, enjoyed BJJ, had a great vacation, and found what to focus on in my work. Next year will be a year of change in my personal life but if I will endure with everything I do I think that the year will also be awesome!
