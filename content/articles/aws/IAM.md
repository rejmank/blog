IAM is an AWS service used for authentication and user management. The basic unit that IAM works with is user. Users have no permissions by default. A user can be a member of up to 10 groups. Each member of a group inherits the permissions assigned to that group. A permission is called policy.

- [Policies]({{<ref "./policy">}})
- [Permission boundaries]({{< ref "./permission-boundaries" >}})
- [Roles](- [IAM]({{< ref "./roles" >}}))
- [Security token service]({{<ref "./sts">}})
- [Attribute and Role based control](<ref "./attribute-and-role-bc">)
