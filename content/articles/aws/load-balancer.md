# load balancing
Load balancers are part of EC2, but we can use them to load containers also. We have two types of load balancers Network Load balancer and Application load balancer. There are also legacy load balancers, no need to know them now.

- [Network Load Balancer]({{<ref "./network-load-balancer">}})
- [Application Load Balancer]({{<ref "./application-load-balancer">}})
- [EC2]({{<ref "./ec2">}})
