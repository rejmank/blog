## Attribute and Role based control
The purpose of both approaches are to give the right users access to right services. The role-based approach is based on users and groups that have a set of policies that define allowed actions. 
The attribute-based approach uses tags that are assigned to users, which then control access to resources. For example, this service can be used by anyone who has a tag developer.

- [Role]({{< ref "./Roles" >}})
