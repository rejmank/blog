## Attribute and Role based control
The purpose of both approaches is to give the right users access to the right services. The role-based approach is based on users and groups that have a set of policies that define allowed actions. 
The attribute-based approach uses tags assigned to users, which then control access to resources. For example, this service can be used by anyone with the tag developer. 

- [IAM]({{< ref "./iam" >}})
- [Role]({{< ref "./Roles" >}})
