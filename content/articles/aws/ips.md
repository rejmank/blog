We have multiple types of IPs in AWS:

**Public** - it is dynamic, its lost when the instance stops and cannot be moved between instances
**Private** - retained when instance is stopped
**Elastic** - its static, charged if not used and can be moved, it is associated with private IP

- [EC2]({{<ref "./ec2">}})
