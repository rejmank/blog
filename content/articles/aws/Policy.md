# Policy
We have two types of policy, resource-based policy and identity-based policy. The difference is that for identity-based policies we say who can do what. For example, users in a developer group can create new AWS lambdas. Resource based policies say what resources like EC2 can do.   

- [IAM]({{< ref "./iam" >}})
- [Role vs policy]({{ref "./role_or_policy"}})
