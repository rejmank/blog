I decided to start compiling the most interesting things I have red or listened to each month. Primary to see what I consume but I hope that you will find something interesting here too.

I started to going through Ted Goya ["humanities in 52 weeks"](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/can-you-really-learn-the-humanities), I will not (most probably) follow it week by week but I will take the readings as a suggestions. 
## Books
- [Plato Euthyphro](https://classics.mit.edu/Plato/euthyfro.html) 
	- Are things good because they are good? Or are they good because we thing about them this way?
 [Ask Aristotle](https://altamira.studio/ask)  [review]({{<ref "../books/ask-aristotle">}}) 
	  - I really like this short book by Altamira studio. What struck me most was how the philosophy aligned to mine... I will continue to explore the Aristotelian thinking and go to the source itself. 
## Articles
 [Rao reading algorithm](https://raohacker.com/rao-reading-algorithm/)  Maybe a bit over my head but interesting peek into the mind of someone who really take his reading seriously. I would like to be also so systematic...
  [Dan Luu - **Some reasons to work on productivity and velocity**](https://danluu.com/productivity-velocity/ ) I struggled with productivity last two months. This is one of the best articles for programmers, more about why to be productive but a few tipsa also. I tried to record myself programming, started to use few shortcuts and hope this will compound. 
 [Nabeel S. Qureshi - principles](https://nabeelqu.substack.com/p/principles)  I like list of principles and I am working on my own. Few great gems in here:
	
```Do things fast. Things don’t actually take much time (as measured by a stopwatch); resistance/procrastination does. “Slow is fake”. If no urgency exists, impose some.```

 ``` Pay attention to your production/consumption balance. If you’re only consuming and not producing, fix that.```

 [Harimus - Kakizome, Japanese way of new-years resolution](https://harimus.github.io//2025/01/02/kakizome.html)  I have my tradition of setting new year goals. Looking back I start to gravitate to similar approach to not having hard SMART goals but "theme of the year". The kaligraphy part really give the practice an elegance.
 [Thorsten Ball - No, typing can be the bottleneck](https://thorstenball.com/blog/2020/09/01/typing-can-be-the-bottleneck/) I think about friction a lot lately. And a lot of things I want to do have writing as a component. Removing friction by being able to put my thougths on the screen efortless is a big friction remover
## Other
- [well tempered clavier](https://open.spotify.com/album/3PWhuYij6e99npMTjTZm2C)
	- part of the first week of humanities in 52 weeks. Good one, listened mostly while working. Will add to the list. 
- [Kneecap](https://www.kneecap.ie/) both movie and music
	- The movie is a BANGER, and so is the music. The Irish struggle for authonomy and language newer thought as something I would like to investigate more, but now Iam. 
- [Viagra Boys - Man Made of Meat](https://open.spotify.com/track/05IdqHMPXSr8dW4rEw5SEZ)
	- I started to get into Viagra Boys a week after their gig in Prague. I hope they will return with new album (releasing end of Marc). The single is great so I have high hopes. 

See you end of February
