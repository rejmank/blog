I decided to start compiling the most interesting things I have red or listened to. I originally planned to compile the stuff each month, but better model is to just put it there as I finish it.  


## 8.3.2025 - Finished Odyssey
"Review" pending... What I ride it was not what I expected at all
## 6.2.2025 - Japanese way of new-years resolution

 [Harimus - Kakizome, Japanese way of new-years resolution](https://harimus.github.io//2025/01/02/kakizome.html)  I have my tradition of setting new year goals. Looking back I start to gravitate to similar approach to not having hard SMART goals but "theme of the year". The kaligraphy part really give the practice an elegance.

## 4.2.2025 - Nabeel S.Qureshi - principles
 [Nabeel S. Qureshi - principles](https://nabeelqu.substack.com/p/principles)  I like list of principles and I am working on my own. Few great gems in here:
 >Do things fast. Things don’t actually take much time (as measured by a stopwatch); resistance/procrastination does. “Slow is fake”. If no urgency exists, impose some.

 > Pay attention to your production/consumption balance. If you’re only consuming and not producing, fix that.

## 3.2.2025
 [Thorsten Ball - No, typing can be the bottleneck](https://thorstenball.com/blog/2020/09/01/typing-can-be-the-bottleneck/) I think about friction a lot lately. And a lot of things I want to do have writing as a component. Removing friction by being able to put my thougths on the screen efortless is a big friction remover
## 1.1.2025 - Humanities in 52 weeks
I started to going through Ted Goya ["humanities in 52 weeks"](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/can-you-really-learn-the-humanities)
