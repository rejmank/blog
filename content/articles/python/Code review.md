## Rules

* Always offer a solution or why something is a problem
* Banned phrases - I ban those phrases for me, If I would use them I would force myself to explain why I would do the change:
  * Best practice -> Better use: this might cause this issue long term
  * readability -> Better use: name Y would be better because I would not need to look into the implementation
  * Clean -> The works combination of the above, just don't
