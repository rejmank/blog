History of USA is a fascinating topic and the people that are voted into higest places are great topic to study. Leadership in turbulent times is actually a short biography of four US presidents with focus on which events shaped the way that each president lead its people. The most interesting part was the realization how much bravery the US leadership lost in last 50? years. I cannot imagine things described in the book beying handled by the current leadership. Doing the right thing, even unpopular and doing it that way that in the end you profit from that. Personally I would cut the number of presidents covered and make the book shorter, I tended to loose a focus towards the end of the book.
