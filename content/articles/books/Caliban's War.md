After almost year from the first book in audio form, the second one in the expanse series finally arived and Iam glad that I waited for the audio version. The production is simply epic. The autor continues in his schtick of writing from perspectives of several characters that in the end come together, in this case on one spaceship. If the first book was a detective story, the second one is a thriller with a political games sprinkled on top. The book starts with an incident that tips the brittle peace into a war and the lives of the four heros inside out. And yes, the protomolecule is in the center of everything as usual. 
I enjoyed all four storylines but my personal favourite was a Avasarala, and old politic that knows her game and how to play it. I simply have a soft spot for the Machiavelian characters. 
Great read, nothing that would blow my brain out but worth it.
