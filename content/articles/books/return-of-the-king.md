First book in my own little research on topic of East India Company and the British empire. Recomended by Cole Wehrle in the notes for the game Pax Pamir (one of my favourites). The book covers the whole british Endeavour with Afghans starting with the Spy prelude through the massacres on both sides. The most interesting part was ironically the last few pages, comparing the situation of US in the region with the one that Britis created for themselves. Another interesting part was the prelude, which reminded me the part of the book clear thinking that covered getting info as close to the source as possible and noticing the motivations of the informers, if those things would the heads of the John Company took into account, the history might be much less bloody. The reason for two stars is that the book did not red well, there were a lot of unnecessary anacrhony words. Add one star if you are interested in the era or want to understand the current Afghanistan.
