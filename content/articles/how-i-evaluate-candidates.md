+++I have recently started conducting many interviews. I wanted to write down how I evaluate potential hires. I mainly want to have something to refer back to and refresh my standards. Inspired by [this](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-good-enough-kills-great-teams-mitchell-petrie-3dy1e/) post.
I usually value personality traits more, such as motivation and curiosity. I think you can teach someone hard skills, but you cannot change the personality.
We use four levels to evaluate and I think its a good framework.

1. Strong no - This one is easy to spot

   1. **Tech:** Clear lack of experience, Avoiding questions, wrong explanations of problems
   1. **Personality**: Disinterested, arguing... There are so much things that can be wrong. Basically most of the people that would get 1 would be a reason for me to quit if we hire them.
1. No - This is the most difficult category to evaluate. Selecting "No" means that the candidate is not the right fit. They might be a level below what we need, or there might be something "off" about them. I always feel that I am too harsh when I give a 2, but in retrospect, it was a good decision most of the time. Another thing that makes the decision between a 2 and a 3 difficult is that I usually feel a 2 for one part and a 3 for the other.

   1. **Tech:** The answers and solution are okay, but the candidate needed more than slight guidance. The candidate did not ask questions to clarify the problem, which is more common than you would think. Candidate chose technology with clear limitations for the use case and did not acknowledge them (e.g., lambda timeout or memory issues). There are a few red flags:
      1. Not knowing cons of some technologies
      1. CV full of buzzwords/technologies
   1. **Personality**: This one is tough, because there usually is not one clear thing that is wrong, but I have few red/yellow flags that I try to spot:
      1. Talking badly about colleagues is a big red flag for me. There's a fine line between a fair evaluation and bashing. A good indicator is whether the candidate talks more about who was wrong than what was wrong. For example, "We did not write tests because the business did not see the value, and we were not able to explain it," versus "The team is bad because we do not write tests."
      1. No questions about the project - It is a good practice to have at least one, this is not a biggie but it contributes to the whole picture.
      1. Talking too much or too little - hard to describe, but you know it when you see it.
1. Yes - This is strong interview. There might be some things that the candidate need to learn. It must be someone I would like to work with.

   1. **Tech** - The candidate is thinking in terms of trade-offs not good/bad. The candidate is asking questions that are relevant to the problem and questions that helps find better solution. You can also tell a lot from how is the candidate able to communicate the solution, the more senior role, the more important this is. There might be some gaps (we expect wide range of skills) but the areas/technologies that the candidate claims to know must be good to great.
   1. **Personality** - I I usually imagine the candidate's onboarding. Will I be excited that he is joining us? There shouldn't be any red flags listed Part 2.
1. Strong yes — this one is easy. After the interview, you really hope that the candidate joins the team. The candidate needs to meet all three criteria from 3. and I always have a strong feeling that he will push the team to the next level and also that I personally will learn from the candidate.
