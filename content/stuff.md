### 05.05.2025 Pentiment

I recently plugged in my old PC to keep my sick child entertained with some cars when he was sick. And since i bought game pass I started to explore if anything interesting is there. And I stumbled upon a pentiment. Iam a big fan of history and also a Disco Elysium so I downloaded it and yea, it was great! I liked how real the world felt, how important the religion is for the people. And the graphics style. The story itself was good enough but it did not hit as much as Disco Elysium. Still well worth playing
